# Robot Plotter

This repository contains the code used for the Arboreal Intuitions 2022-23 project.

## Getting Started

First things first, you will need any version of the Arduino 1.8 IDE. You can download that [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/OldSoftwareReleases). Once downloaded, you should find a "libraries" folder in "C:\\Users\\`{username}`\\Documents\\Arduino".

## Installation

Copy the `grbl-mod` folder into your Arduino libraries folder (`%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Arduino\libraries` on windows)
